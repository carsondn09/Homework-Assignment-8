>>>     #CHAPTER 8 DISCUSSION QUESTION 1
>>> #1a)    A definite loop runs a specific number of times, usually using a for loop when the number of repetitions is known in advance. An indefinite loop, usually written with a while loop. It keeps running until a certain condition is met, making the number of repetitions unpredictable.
>>> #1b)    A for loop is used when you know in advance how many times you want to repeat a set of statements, usually looping through a sequence or range of numbers. But a while loop is used when you donâ€™t know beforehand how many times the loop should run, it continues executing as long as a given condition remains true.
>>> #1c)    An interactive loop keeps running until the user decides otherwise, after each repitition the program will "ask the user" if they want to continue running the loop. While a sentinel loop repeats until a specific value, called a sentinel is entered. this will signal the program to stop repeating the code
>>> #1d)    Like i said above the sentinel loop runs until a sentinel value is entered by the user and the program will then stop repeating the code. but an end-of-file loop continues to read the input until it reaches the end of the file like the title says, or the end of the input stream. where it will then stop running automatically once there is no more data available, rather than relying on a special sentinel value
>>>     #CHAPTER 8 DISCUSSION QUESTION 2
>>> #2a) only True when both P and Q are not true
>>> #2b) True only if P is false and Q is true
>>> #2c) True if at least one of either P or Q is false
>>> #2d) True if either both P and Q are true or R is false
>>> #2e) True if P or R is true and q or R is true
>>>     #CHAPTER 8 DISCUSSION QUESTION 3
>>> #3a) n =int(input("Enter a positive integer n: ")) #this gets the n from user
>>> #    total =0
>>> #    i =1 #this starts the counting from 1 rather than 0
>>> #    while i <=n:
>>> #         total = total +i #this adds the current value to the recurring total
>>> #         i =i+1 #this moves onto the next number in sequence after we add the current number to our total
>>> #    print("The sum of the first", n, "counting numbers is: ", total)
>>> #3b) total =0
>>> #    number =int(input("Enter a number(999 to stop): "))
#    while number !=999:
#         total =total+number #add curent number to our total
#         number =int(input("Enter a number(999 to stop): ")) #this gets our next number from the user
